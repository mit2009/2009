<h1>Project Timesheet</h1>
    <p><a href="#background">background</a>, <a href="#use">use in 2.009</a>, <a href="DesignTimeSheetSubmission.html">preparation and submission</a></p>
    <p><a name="background"></a>In professional 
          design practice we are typically required to track and bill our time to the different projects on which we are working. Different types of activities are often billed at different rates, so the type of activity is also recorded. 
    </p>
    <p>We are using an online timesheet tool to make the process as convenient as possible. The categories of the timesheet are fairly detailed, so please make  entries into your timesheet on a regular, daily basis when you are working on 2.009 project... when your memory is fresh.    </p>
<p><strong><a name="use"></a>Use in 2.009</strong><br>
          From a learning viewpoint, the structure of the timesheets provide a reminder of the types of things one is likely to be doing in a product development process, and reflecting upon your effort will help to improve skills estimating how long different types of tasks take, and what they would cost in practice. Additionally, the aggregate time data and labor cost estimates will be useful for your team in developing your product's business model.</p>
          <p>Your timesheets are private. Your <strong>lab instructors</strong>, who are responsible for grading, <strong>will not see the timesheets</strong>.The course instructor and the TAs will also not see your timesheet. A 3rd party will check your submissions, <a href="Assignments.html#timesheet">which are due</a> the day after each project milestone, and provide feedback on recording. Aggregate time data (not individual) will be provided to your team for the purpose of labor cost estimation. Also, the course instructor will use the aggregate information in the timesheets (after the class is over) to improve the 2.009 product development process through a detailed understanding of the resources needed during different phases of the project. Please bill your time as correctly as possible since the goal is to obtain accurate information. </p>
          <p>There will be five timesheets due throughout the semester, one for each of the major milestones after the 3 ideas presentations.</p>
          <p><a href="DesignTimeSheetActivities.html">Descriptions of the activities</a> are available for reference and includes examples of how to categorize your time based on frequently asked questions from students in the past. Please review the examples before you start working on your timesheet.</p>
          <p>For step-by-step instructions on how to log your time, please see the  instructions on <a href="DesignTimeSheetSubmission.html"><strong>how to prepare and submit your timesheet</strong></a>.    </p>
